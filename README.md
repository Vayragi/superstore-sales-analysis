# 🛒 Superstore Sales Analysis Project (Excel-Based)

This project is part of my business analyst learning journey, where I used Microsoft Excel to analyze sales, profit, and performance trends from the Superstore dataset.

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify regions, segments, and product categories with high sales but low profits.
- Deliver actionable insights through visual dashboards and summarized reports.
- Simulate KPIs like Profit Margin, Cost of Shipping, and Return Rate.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)
- Data Cleaning & Formulas
- Manual Simulation (Returns, Margins)

## 📊 Key Deliverables
| Component             | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `Dashboard.xlsx`     | Interactive Excel dashboard with slicers and visuals |
| `Cleaned_Superstore_Data.xlsx` | Processed dataset with calculated columns |

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Texas, Ohio, and Pennsylvania showed **high sales but negative profit**.
- Delaware, Vermont, and Rhode Island had **low sales but strong margins**, indicating growth potential.
- Office Supplies segment suffered due to **low margins**, while Technology had the **highest profitability**.

## 📝 Recommendations
